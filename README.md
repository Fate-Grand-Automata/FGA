Auto-battle app for Fate/Grand Order (Android 7 or later, no need for Root).  

Download from our [Website](https://MathewSachin.github.io/Fate-Grand-Automata).

This is pretty much a **Kotlin** port of [Fate-Grand-Order_Lua][FGOLua] with UI for configuring Settings and inbuilt Sikuli like API.
And there's no time limit on the use of the app unlike FGO-Lua.

## Why make another?
FGO-Lua is really great, but:
1. Uses AnkuLua, so isn't free. Free version has 30min time-limit.
2. Learning curve for configuring the scripts is steeper.
3. Difficult to edit the script on your phone. You can do it using Text editor apps, but it's not fun, trust me.

Making the app was a great learning experience and something different from your usual Android projects.

## How does it work?
This is a native Android app written in Kotlin.
We use [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for image recognition,
[Media Projection](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjection) for taking screenshots
and [Accessibility Service](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility) for clicking/swiping.

## How to Use?
1. Download from the [Website](https://MathewSachin.github.io/Fate-Grand-Automata). I can't put this app on `Play Store` due to some restrictive features this app uses.
2. Install on your phone. You'll need to enable installing apps out of `Play Store`.
3. Launch the app. Grant it permissions it asks for: `Read External Storage`, `Write External Storage`, `Ignore Battery Optimizations`.
4. Click on `Toggle Service`. You would be prompted to turn on the `Accessibility Service` and taken to `Accessibility Settings` page.
   If it is already ON, turn it OFF and then turn it ON again.
   If you turned ON `Accessibility Service` right now, click again on `Toggle Service`.
5. You would be asked for `Media Projection` permission.
6. Now, you can see a button with play icon on it floating on screen.
7. Open F/GO and Go to the node you want to farm.
8. Press Play to start. The same button can be pressed to stop later.

## How to configure?
For how the settings work, see the original [Fate-Grand-Order_Lua][FGOLua] project.

AutoSkill configuration can be created at `Settings/AutoSkill/Manage AutoSkill configurations`.  
If you've set a Servant or CE in the selected AutoSkill configuration and AutoSkill is Enabled, then support selection mode is assumed to be preferred.

## Where to put Servant/CE images?
Put:
- Servant images in `Fate-Grand-Automata/support/servant` folder
- CE images in `Fate-Grand-Automata/support/ce` folder
- Friend name images in `Fate-Grand-Automata/support/friend` folder

The app has some common Servant/CEs inbuilt. You can extract them using the `Extract Default Support Images` option.
The app should extract them automatically when you go to the Support settings screen.
If you want to use any other preferred servant or ce, you have to create their images using `Support Image Maker` script.

Instead of having to select multiple ascension images for a servant, you can put all the images of a servant in a folder and select the folder in settings.

Here's what an example directory structure looks like:

```
Fate-Grand-Automata/
-- support/
-- -- servants/
-- -- -- ozy4.png
-- -- -- melt4.png
-- -- -- Merlin/
-- -- -- -- merlin1.png
-- -- -- -- merlin2.png
-- -- -- -- merlin3.png
-- -- -- -- merlin4.png
-- -- -- -- merlin_c.png
-- -- -- Waver/
-- -- -- -- waver1.png
-- -- -- -- waver2.png
-- -- -- -- waver3.png
-- -- -- -- waver4.png
-- -- ce/
-- -- -- kscope.png
-- -- -- black_grail.png
-- -- friend/
-- -- -- mathew.png
-- -- -- recon.png
```

## What about other scripts like Lottery and Friend Gacha?
There is an option in Settings called `Script Mode`.
It defaults to `Battle`.
Set it to the script you require.

## How to use Support Image Maker?
`Support Image Maker` automatically creates images from the Support screen that can be used with the script.
You can also use it from the Friend List which is easier since you don't have to keep refreshing till the desired Servant/CE shows up.

1. Set the `Script Mode` option in Settings to `Support Image Maker`.
2. Now, click on `Toggle Service` button, the `Play` button shows itself.
3. Open F/GO. Go to support selection or friend list screen and ensure that the Servant/CE you want is visible (It is important that the complete Servant + CE region is visible).
4. Click on Play. Support Image Namer dialog should pop up.
5. Check the images you want to keep. Type a name for the image (NO NEED for file-format like `.png`).
   For servant images, you can use a folder like: `Nero/asc1`. This will save an image named `asc1.png` in `Fate-Grand-Automata/support/servant/Nero` folder. By grouping in a folder, you can pick a single entry in settings to match with all ascensions and costumes.
6. Click on `Done`. The selected images are saved to the correct folders.
5. Use the images with Auto Support Selection.

## Like the project? Want to support me?
~~Just pray that I can roll [Skadi](https://gamepress.gg/grandorder/servant/scathachskadi)!~~ `SUCCESS!`  
Oh, and code/doc contributions are surely welcome!

I really didn't want to put up a donation link, but a lot of people kept asking me, more so because they don't have to pay for AnkuLua now.
After using up a lot apples I had saved for Gilfest when testing new features, I think accepting a few rainbow apples won't hurt.

You can send rainbow apples here: https://paypal.me/MathewSachin.

**Disclaimer:** This is my (@MathewSachin's) personal link, the amount won’t go to other developers if you donate there.
Since this project is a fork of FGO-lua, there is a lot of work involved from the developers there.
Only donate for what you feel I have added over the FGO-lua project.

---

Thanks for the rainbow apples.
