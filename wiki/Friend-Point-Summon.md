Friend Point Summon script won't do the daily free summon. You have to do the daily free summon yourself.

It can start after you've done the daily free summon:

Or, you can also start it from the summon results screen:

This script won't start on Saint Quartz summon screen as a safeguard, unless you start from the summon results screen.
