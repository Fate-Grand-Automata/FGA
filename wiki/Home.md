Welcome to the Fate-Grand-Automata wiki!

WIKI IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

#### Things we're absolutely against

This app is only meant to automate repetitive farming battles.  
We don't plan on supporting things that could possibly lead to the creation of bot accounts which need no supervision from users OR things that will be blatant violation of FGO's ToS.

We won't provide support for:
1. Re-rolling scripts
2. Automatically logging in at the reset times
3. Doing the story for you
4. Messing with the game data or network connections
5. Playing with screen turned OFF or FGO not in foreground
6. Playing offline (someone did DM me for this if you're wondering)
