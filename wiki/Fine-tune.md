First things first, before reporting any issues, try resetting these to defaults. 
The defaults should be good enough. Don't be too dumb when setting the values and complain to me that things don't work. Ideal values will vary between phones and potatoes.

### Wait after clicking (ms)
Delay after each click/tap unless clicking repeatedly. Some time is needed for the game's animations to finish.

### Click duration (ms)
Every tap/click is like a hold and release performed quickly. This sets the time difference between the two.

### Multi-click delay (ms)
Delay between individual taps/clicks when doing so repeatedly like at the end of battles, friend point summon and lottery script.

### Wait after swiping (ms)
Wait after all swipes.
Right now, it is only used when searching for friend supports and in Gift Box script, but will also be used for cases where any other swipes get added in future. Some time is needed for the game's animations to finish.

### Swipe duration (ms)
Time taken to swipe. Swiping faster will scroll more, slower will scroll less.

### Support Swipe Multiplier (%)
Control the length of swipes in support screen. This multiples with the number of pixels to swipe over. Use along with swipe duration to tweak it to your needs.

### Wait Multiplier (%)
This multiples to every wait/delay. So, you can make the overall script slower/faster by using this.
