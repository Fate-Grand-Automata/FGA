# Running on Samsung devices

If the script's not working correctly on your Samsung phone, like missing touches or not doing anything at all, follow these steps:

- Make sure you're running F/GO with Full screen mode ON in Samsung's settings. Blue-bars should be shown in the space which is not used by FGO. If you did this wrong, that area would be black.
- Go to `More options` in the app and turn ON `Ignore Notch calculation`. The app should automatically turn this ON for Samsung devices.
