Translate the following text to Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese.

Add <!-- missing translation --> at the top of each translation

{{ text }}

Follow the format of the original text but substitute the translated text in place of the original text.

Make it easy to copy the translations by putting each translation in a code block with the language specified.

You also need to indicate the language of each translation outside the code block so I can't copy it but will know which language it is.

For example:

Japanese:
```xml
<!-- missing translation -->
<string name="example">これは例です</string>
```
