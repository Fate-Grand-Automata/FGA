Before opening an issue:

- [x] I don't know how to properly check the checkbox (Put a check in the checkbox by filling in an `x` between the `[ ]` brackets)
- [ ] My question isn't answered in any other issues (even the [closed ones](https://github.com/Fate-Grand-Automata/FGA/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed))
- [ ] I'm not reporting a bug/error

> If you open unnecessary/dumb issues, you'll be rewarded with appropriate tags.
