Use for other games


I would need help simplifying your project.
I currently use ankulua and have working scripts for some games. 
I would like to create a universal base app that allows you to use lua scripts. 
Basically an open version of ankulua. The idea is to have an app with only one button,
for selecting scripts and a folder to load the images to search with openCv.
