# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how Fate/Grand Automata (FGA) handles your information and protects your privacy.

## Information We Collect

### Data NOT Collected
FGA is designed with privacy in mind. We **DO NOT** collect:

- **Personal information**: No names, emails, or personal identifiers
- **Game account data**: No FGO account information or login credentials
- **Gameplay data**: No information about your servants, progress, or activities
- **Device information**: No device identifiers, location data, or hardware information
- **Usage analytics**: No tracking of how you use the app
- **Crash reports**: No automatic crash or error reporting

### Data That May Be Processed Locally
FGA processes the following data **locally on your device only**:

- **Screenshots**: Captured for image recognition purposes

**Important**: All of this data remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.

## How We Process Information

### Local Processing Only
- **All image recognition** happens entirely on your device
- **No cloud processing** or external AI services are used
- **No data transmission** to FGA servers or third parties
- **Complete offline operation** after initial app installation

### Data Storage
- **Device storage only**: All data is stored locally on your device
- **No cloud backup**: Settings and configurations are not backed up to cloud services
- **User control**: You can delete all app data at any time through Android settings

## Permissions and Access

### Required Permissions
FGA requires certain Android permissions to function:

#### Accessibility Service
- **Purpose**: Automate touches and swipes in the game
- **Scope**: Limited to Fate/Grand Order when FGA is active
- **Control**: Can be disabled in Android settings at any time

#### Screen Capture (MediaProjection)
- **Purpose**: Capture screenshots for image recognition
- **Scope**: Only captures game screen when automation is running
- **Control**: Android shows notification when active, can be stopped anytime

#### Overlay/System Alert Window
- **Purpose**: Display the FGA control button over other apps
- **Scope**: Only shows FGA controls, doesn't access other app content
- **Control**: Can be disabled in Android settings

### Permissions NOT Used
FGA does **NOT** request or use:
- **Internet access**: No network connections for data collection
- **Camera access**: No access to device cameras
- **Microphone access**: No audio recording capabilities
- **Contact access**: No access to personal contacts
- **Location services**: No location tracking
- **SMS/Phone access**: No communication features

## Data Security

### Local Security
- **Encrypted storage**: App data uses Android's standard app data protection
- **No transmission**: No data leaves your device
- **Sandbox isolation**: App operates within Android's security sandbox
- **User control**: Complete control over app data and permissions

### No External Risks
Since FGA doesn't transmit data externally:
- **No data breaches possible**: There are no external servers to compromise
- **No third-party access**: No external services can access your data
- **No tracking**: No analytics or tracking services are integrated

## Third-Party Services

### Services NOT Used
FGA does not integrate with:

- **Crash reporting services** (Crashlytics, Bugsnag, etc.)
- **Advertising networks** (AdMob, etc.)
- **Social media platforms** (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
- **Cloud services** (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

### Open Source Components
FGA uses open-source libraries:
- **OpenCV**: For image processing (runs locally)
- **Android standard libraries**: For app functionality
- **Kotlin/Java libraries**: For app development

These libraries are well-audited and do not collect user data.

## Game Interaction

### Fate/Grand Order
- **No game modification**: FGA doesn't modify game files or data
- **No network interference**: Doesn't intercept or modify game network traffic
- **Surface-level interaction only**: Only interacts through Android's accessibility APIs
- **Game ToS consideration**: Users are responsible for compliance with game terms

### Detection and Safety
- **Designed to be undetectable**: Uses human-like timing and behavior
- **No game data access**: Cannot read internal game data
- **No cheating capabilities**: Only automates what a human could do manually

## User Rights and Control

### Your Control
You have complete control over:
- **App installation and removal**: Install or uninstall at any time
- **Permission management**: Enable or disable permissions through Android settings
- **Data deletion**: Clear app data or uninstall to remove all information
- **Usage control**: Start and stop automation as desired

### Data Portability
- **Settings export**: You can export your battle configurations
