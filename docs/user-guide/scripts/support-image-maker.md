# Support Image Maker

The Support Image Maker helps you create custom support servant images for better recognition accuracy during automated support selection.

## Overview

FGA uses image recognition to identify and select support servants. The Support Image Maker allows you to create custom images that improve the accuracy of this detection, especially for:

- **Specific servants** you frequently use
- **Event servants** with bonuses
- **Friend supports** with specific configurations
- **Rare or new servants** not well-recognized by default

## When to Use

Consider using the Support Image Maker when:

- FGA frequently selects the wrong support servant
- You want to prioritize specific friend supports
- New servants aren't being recognized properly
- Event servants need better detection accuracy

## How to Access

The Support Image Maker becomes available when you're on the support selection screen:

1. Navigate to the support selection screen in FGO
2. Tap the FGA play button
3. Look for the "Support Image Maker" button in the bottom-left corner of the popup

## Creating Support Images

### Basic Process

1. **Navigate to support screen** in FGO
2. **Tap Support Image Maker** button
3. **Select the servant** you want to create an image for
4. **Capture the image** following the on-screen guidelines
5. **Save and name** the image for future use

### Best Practices for Image Capture

#### Lighting and Display
- **Good lighting**: Ensure your screen is clearly visible
- **No overlays**: Remove any screen filters or blue light filters
- **Full brightness**: Use maximum screen brightness for capture
- **Clean screen**: Make sure there are no smudges or reflections

#### Servant Selection
- **Full portrait**: Capture the complete servant portrait
- **Clear view**: Ensure the servant card is fully visible
- **No animations**: Wait for any animations to complete
- **Standard view**: Don't use any special camera angles or effects

#### Image Quality
- **High resolution**: Use the highest quality capture settings
- **Sharp focus**: Ensure the image is not blurry
- **Good contrast**: Make sure the servant stands out clearly
- **No interference**: Avoid capturing during loading screens or transitions

## Types of Support Images

### Servant Images
- **General servant recognition**: Basic servant identification
- **Ascension-specific**: Different images for different ascensions
- **Event variants**: Special event versions of servants

### Friend Images
- **Friend names**: Capture friend usernames for specific friend targeting
- **Friend icons**: Player icons for additional identification
- **Combined recognition**: Both servant and friend information

### CE Images
- **Event CEs**: Craft Essences with event bonuses
- **Specific CEs**: Particular CEs you want to prioritize
- **MLB CEs**: Max limit broken versions

## Managing Support Images

### Organization
- **Descriptive names**: Use clear, descriptive names for images
- **Categories**: Organize by servant class, event, or usage
- **Regular updates**: Update images when servants change (new ascensions, etc.)

### Testing and Validation
- **Test recognition**: Verify that created images work correctly
- **Multiple scenarios**: Test with different support lists
- **Fine-tuning**: Adjust images if recognition isn't accurate

### Maintenance
- **Regular cleanup**: Remove outdated or unused images
- **Event updates**: Create new images for event servants
- **Performance monitoring**: Track which images work best

## Troubleshooting Image Creation

### Poor Recognition Accuracy

**Possible Causes:**
- Low image quality during capture
- Screen overlays or filters interfering
- Inconsistent lighting conditions
- Servant animations during capture

**Solutions:**
- Recapture with better lighting
- Disable screen filters temporarily
- Wait for animations to complete
- Use maximum screen brightness

### Image Not Being Used

**Possible Causes:**
- Image not properly saved
- Incorrect naming or categorization
- Support configuration not set to use custom images

**Solutions:**
- Verify image was saved correctly
- Check image naming conventions
- Review support selection settings

### Multiple Images Conflicting

**Possible Causes:**
- Similar images for different servants
- Overlapping recognition patterns
- Too many similar images

**Solutions:**
- Create more distinct images
- Remove duplicate or similar images
- Use more specific image capture

## Advanced Techniques

### Event Optimization
- **Bonus servants**: Create images for all event bonus servants
- **CE combinations**: Capture servant/CE combinations for events
- **Temporary images**: Create event-specific images and remove after events

### Friend Prioritization
- **High-priority friends**: Create images for friends with strong servants
- **Event friends**: Prioritize friends with event bonuses
- **Backup options**: Create images for fallback friend choices

### Automation Integration
- **Battle config coordination**: Align support images with battle configurations
- **Script-specific images**: Create images for specific farming scripts
- **Performance optimization**: Use images that improve overall automation speed

## Image Storage and Backup

### File Management
- Support images are stored in the app's data directory
- Regular backups are recommended
- Images can be exported and imported between devices

### Sharing and Collaboration
- Share successful image configurations with the community
- Learn from other users' image setups
- Contribute to community image databases

## Performance Impact

### Positive Effects
- **Improved accuracy**: Better support selection accuracy
- **Faster automation**: Reduced time spent searching for supports
- **More reliable scripts**: Fewer failures due to wrong support selection

### Considerations
- **Storage space**: Custom images use device storage
- **Processing time**: More images may slightly increase processing time
- **Maintenance overhead**: Requires periodic updates and cleanup
