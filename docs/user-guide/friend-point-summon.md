# Friend Point Summon Automation

FGA can automate the Friend Point summoning process to help you efficiently use accumulated Friend Points.

## Overview

Friend Point summon automation handles:

- **Automatic summoning** using Friend Points
- **Batch summoning** for efficiency
- **Inventory management** during summoning
- **CE and servant handling** from summons

## When to Use

Friend Point automation is useful for:

- **Daily FP usage**: Clearing daily Friend Point accumulation
- **Event periods**: When FP campaigns provide bonus items
- **Inventory management**: Converting FP to useful items
- **CE collection**: Obtaining low-rarity CEs for various purposes

## How It Works

### Automation Process
1. **Navigate to Friend summon** screen
2. **Select summoning options** (single/multi-summon)
3. **Execute summons** automatically
4. **Handle results** and inventory management
5. **Continue** until FP exhaustion or stop conditions

### Summoning Options
- **Single summons**: One at a time for careful control
- **Multi-summons**: 10x summons for efficiency
- **Mixed approach**: Combination based on FP available

## Configuration Settings

### Summoning Behavior
- **Summon type preference**: Single vs multi-summon priority
- **FP usage limits**: Maximum FP to spend per session
- **Summon count limits**: Maximum number of summons to perform
- **Time limits**: Duration limits for automation sessions

### Inventory Management
- **Auto-burn low-rarity servants**: Automatically convert 1-2★ servants to QP
- **CE handling**: Keep or burn low-rarity CEs
- **Inventory monitoring**: Track space usage during summoning
- **Overflow handling**: Behavior when inventory becomes full

### Stop Conditions
- **FP threshold**: Stop when FP falls below specified amount
- **Inventory full**: Stop when inventory reaches capacity
- **Target achieved**: Stop after collecting specific items
- **Time limits**: Maximum automation duration

## Inventory Considerations

### Servant Management
**Low-rarity servants** (1-3★):
- **Auto-burn option**: Convert directly to QP and materials
- **Selective keeping**: Keep specific servants for various purposes
- **Experience usage**: Use as experience for other servants

**Higher-rarity servants** (4-5★):
- **Always keep**: Never automatically burn valuable servants
- **Manual review**: Pause automation for manual decision
- **Special handling**: Flag for attention

### CE Management
**Low-rarity CEs** (1-3★):
- **Burn for prisms**: Convert to Mana Prisms
- **Keep useful**: Retain CEs with useful effects
- **Experience fodder**: Use for CE experience

**Event CEs and useful CEs**:
- **Always preserve**: Never burn potentially useful CEs
- **Manual review**: Pause for manual evaluation

### Space Management
- **Pre-clear inventory**: Ensure adequate space before starting
- **Monitor capacity**: Track inventory usage during summoning
- **Pause when full**: Stop automation when space is needed
- **Resume after cleanup**: Continue after manual inventory management

## Usage Instructions

### Starting FP Summoning

1. **Navigate to Friend summon** in FGO
2. **Ensure adequate inventory space**
3. **Tap the FGA play button**
4. **Select Friend Point automation** if available
5. **Configure your summoning preferences**
6. **Start automation**

### During Automation

**Monitor:**
- **FP usage**: Track Friend Points being spent
- **Inventory status**: Watch for space issues
- **Summon results**: Notable servants or CEs obtained
- **Time elapsed**: Duration of summoning session

**Intervention options:**
- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily stop summoning
- **Manual decisions**: Handle specific summon results manually
- **Inventory management**: Clear space when needed
- **Stop early**: End session before reaching limits

## Event Considerations

### FP Campaigns
During special Friend Point campaigns:
- **Increased rates**: Better chances for rare items
- **Bonus servants**: Special servants available in FP gacha
- **Time-limited**: Campaign duration affects strategy

### Event CEs
- **Event CE availability**: Some events add CEs to FP gacha
- **Collection priority**: Focus on obtaining event-specific items
- **Limited time**: Campaign end dates affect urgency

## Optimization Strategies

### Efficient FP Usage
- **Batch summoning**: Use 10x summons for speed
- **Timing considerations**: Summon during campaigns for better value
- **Regular usage**: Avoid FP cap by regular summoning

### Inventory Optimization
- **Pre-summoning cleanup**: Clear unnecessary items before starting
- **Strategic burning**: Plan which items to keep vs convert
- **Experience planning**: Use summoned servants/CEs for experience

### Resource Management
- **QP consideration**: Balance QP gain from burning with other sources
- **Mana Prism management**: Plan prism usage from CE burning
- **Material priorities**: Focus on materials you actually need

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Automation Getting Stuck

**Possible Causes:**
- Inventory full dialog not handled properly

- Unexpected game UI changes

**Solutions:**
- Clear inventory space manually and resume
- Check network connection stability
- Update FGA if game UI has changed

### Incorrect Item Handling

**Possible Causes:**
- Configuration settings incorrect
- Recognition issues with new items
- Game updates affecting detection

**Solutions:**
- Review automation settings
- Check for FGA updates
- Report recognition issues

### Performance Issues

**Possible Causes:**
- Too many summons in sequence
- Device overheating during long sessions
- Memory usage building up

**Solutions:**
- Take breaks between summoning sessions
- Reduce batch sizes
- Restart FGA periodically

## Best Practices

### Session Planning
- **Set realistic limits**: Don't try to use all FP at once
- **Plan inventory**: Ensure adequate space
- **Choose good timing**: Use during campaigns when possible

### Monitoring
- **Regular check-ins**: Monitor progress periodically
- **Be ready to intervene**: Handle unexpected situations
- **Review results**: Check what was obtained

### Resource Management
