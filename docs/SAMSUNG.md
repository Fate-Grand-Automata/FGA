If the script's not working correctly on your Samsung phone, like missing touches or not doing anything at all, follow these steps:

- Make sure you're running F/GO with Full screen mode ON in Samsung's settings. See "Turn on Full screen apps" on [this page](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00079034/) for a guide. Blue bars should be shown in the space which is not used by FGO. If you did this wrong, that area would be black.
- Go to `More options` in the app and turn ON `Ignore Notch calculation`.
  **YOU MIGHT NEED TO TURN THIS OFF AFTER THE ENGINE UPDATE**
