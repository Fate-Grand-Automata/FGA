title: Running on Emulators

Even with many emulators available with Android 7+ support, `MediaProjection` doesn't work on the ones we've tried. So, you need to enable `Use Root for Screenshots` in `More options`.

If nothing works, try using [FGO-Lua](https://github.com/29988122/Fate-Grand-Order_Lua).

## Supported Emulators
We'll list the supported emulators we've confirmed here.

### Nox (Android 7) for FGO JP

FGO JP can be used on Nox (Android 7) with `Use Root for Screenshots` option.
You also need to enable `Root` from Nox's settings.

FGO NA doesn't work since it doesn't work with root. It might work after the engine update.
